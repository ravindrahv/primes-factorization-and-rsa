This algorithm / technique for factorising charmichael numbers was identified around 2017 while I was employed.

The algorithm / pseudo-code dated 30-July-2017 can be found here.

The claim to copyright on this program is on the basis of the fact that I am no longer employed and also with regard to the fact that I had include sorting and rsa related algorithms in the exceptions list as part of the IP prior to joining the organization. 


Addendum - It appears that the technique is not so novel after all. Just that I'd forgotten it.
